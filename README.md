City Pantry JS Coding Test
==========================

This repository contains the files providen as solution to City Paintry Coding test, makes use of node, angular, bootstrap and City Pantry's library.

Requirements: 
NodeJs must be installed and configured to run the unit tests and the project easily, otherwise get your favorite browser (please not an old one without modern js support, eh!)

Running:
Either publish the files in a web server or run the following command in a terminal inside the project's folder 'npm start-test' , this will execute the test suite and run a local web server. Usually after a successful execution the server should be published at port 8000 being accessible through 'http://localhost:8000'.

Also 'npm start' may be used to run the server only without passing the test or 'npm test' may be used to run the tests only.
